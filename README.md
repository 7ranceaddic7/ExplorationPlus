# ExplorationPlus

Replacement Exploration Contracts for KSP. Forked from @severedsolo's original package for my personal use. My changes include:

- Multiple orbiting and landing contracts simultaneously (handles vessels graciously). The mod still shows the "Start exploring X" in a natural progression, but if you do a flyby it will immediately open a "Land on X" mission.
- A new "Return from X" contract which asks for you to land with a manned vessel and then return if you have not done so. I disliked the "mopping up" contract for landing and planting flags, so I created a unique mission. This works nicely when (like I do) you first send a rover and then create a manned mission. This seemed like a natural progression to me.

Installation Instructions:

1. Install the mod [ContractConfigurator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/91625-18x-contract-configurator-v1280-2019-10-17/).
2. In your GameData/ContractPacks folder (create it if not present) unzip this package. It should look like GameData/ContractPacks/ExplorationPlus and inside all the files.
3. Enjoy the new contracts!
